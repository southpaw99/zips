[B][COLOR red]Update - v5.1.5 - June 12, 2021[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Please Note I have re-opened github issues. Hopefully I do not regret it!!  Conduct yourself
    accordingly and hopefully I can help in my spare time.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed, Search Movie and Tvshow title search, loading virtual keyboard a second time upon any
    CM action used on the query results.  Also choosing cancel on the virtual keyboard no
    longer results in an infinite busy dialog.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trakt Manager now respects your global "Highlight Color" from General category Setting for text
    items, default Red is now gone.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trakt Manager now sets "watched" and "unwatched" listItem options based on received playcount.
     No longer will both "mark as watched" and "mark as unwatched" be seen at the same
    time.  The Venom Global Context Menu addon has also been updated for this change.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trakt Manager "rate" and "unrate" listItem options are now only available if the trakt addon
    is installed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] All language translation .po file have now been updated.  Any requested changes please
    issue PR.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Meta API language changes fixed to now respect setting.  This is still a work in progress so please
    issue PR for further changes.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Progress scrape dialog now respects the global "Highlight Color" from General category Setting for
    fixed text, default cyan is now gone. The "Scraper Dialog Highlight Color" setting respects variable text.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed meta retrieval from Kodi library when supplied TMDb meta vs. IMDb meta differs for year check.
    This is seen when scraping for example "Flashback" from library item. IMDb reports
    2020 while TMDb reports 2021 for year released. Now a year +1 and -1 check is
    conducted for the match and the Kodi library meta is now retrieved..[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed widget refresh issue when global CM Trakt Manager is used.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Source filtering options now have a separate settings for Min. and Max. file size limits for Movies as
    well as Episodes.[/I]
