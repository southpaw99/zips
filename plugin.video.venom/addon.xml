[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.1.0 – Sept. 03, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "File Name Format" option to downloads.  You
    have the option of "Title (year) or Title S01E01", which is
    the older file naming method.  Or you can chose
    "torrent file name".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed random issue where meta fallback would replace
    "tvshowtitle" with episode "title".  This caused issues with
    OpenInfo or TMDbHelper failing lookup of the show.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed playback issue with OpenInfo where video playing
    was in background.  This occurred when a search was
    performed first and then accessing OpenInfo to play
    from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed PM expiry date when viewing Account Info.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for cache checking and
    removal of uncached torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for resolving of pack files
    for playback.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for context menu option to
    cache uncached torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for downloading from source
    select.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for "Browse Debrid Pack".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed "My Movies" "Date Added" sorting.  Previously it
    was stuck at descending sort order due to Trakt api key
    for "listed_at" was not assigned.  This is now fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed "Unfinished" in My Movies and My TV Shows
    to "Continue Watching".  Limit has been reduced to 40
    items. Trakt On Deck is now removed as this was the
    same list with only 20 items so I feel this was a good
    compromise. Sort order is now set to be based on date
    paused.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] "reuselanguageinvoker" is now officially hard coded on.
    There is a new service settings management system
    courtesy of Tikipeter,  so credit goes to him!!![/I]  There
    is still an option for user to turn this off if not comfortable. 
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TVShows Originals is now on
    by default.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Youtube is now on by default.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Please be sure to update "context.venom" to v1.0.6 for
    compliant changes.[/I]
